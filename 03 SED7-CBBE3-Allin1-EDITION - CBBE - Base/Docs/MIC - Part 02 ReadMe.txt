Welcome to MIC - Make it compatible

This will be a series of selected mods which will be made compatible with Devious Devices - Assets and Devious Devices - Captured Dreamshop and also will be made compatible with each other so that you don't find yourself in a situation where you could put two different nipple piercings on your character, for example.

SED7 Accessoire Piercingset for CBBE

Changes

	* Fixed the keywords for all items (Removed ArmorLight and ClothingRing keywords and also added JewelryExpensive keyword if the base value of that item was lower than 100 gold)
    * Merged the different *.esp's into a single one
    * Removed the Nipplewand items because there were no meshes provided for it which otherwise would have resulted into an invisible item
	* Removed the temper recipes because the items don't provide armor anymore
    * Changed the armor rating of the items to 0
    * Labiarings now use slot 49 (matching the slot number of DD - Assets Chastity Belt)
    * Nipplerings now use slot 56 (matching the slot number of DD - Assets Chastity Bra)
	* Navel piercings now use slot 47
