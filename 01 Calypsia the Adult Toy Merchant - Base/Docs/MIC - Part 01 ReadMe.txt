Welcome to MIC - Make it compatible

This will be a series of selected mods which will be made compatible with Devious Devices - Assets and Devious Devices - Captured Dreamshop and also will be made compatible with each other so that you don't find yourself in a situation where you could put two different nipple piercings on your character, for example.
